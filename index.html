# Finding products

## Ali Express (aliexpress.com)

* Ali Express connects small businesses to buyers
* Sort of like what eBay wants to be

# What can I Buy?

## Everything

---

# Finding

## Search or Browse

* If you know what you want, search
* If you just want shinies, browse categories
* The recommendation engine is quite good

]

---

# Choosing

* Free shipping?
* Sort by Price, but look out for shipping cost
* Country of origin may affect price
* Quantity may affect shipping cost
* Use your wishlist to shortlist items
* Review seller feedback


---

# Buying

* Select shipping cost
* Select product options (eg colour, power supply)
* Consider power plugs (ask for an AU plug)

# Shipping

* Free but slow - 4-6wk
* ePacket - few bucks, 1-2wks
* Courier - sometimes cheap, sometimes not
* "AliExpress Premium Shipping" is often DHL
* Negotiate the shipping price if it appears excessive

---

# Negotiating on shipping

.leftish[
1. Contact seller, "I want to buy N of these, can you provide a shipping correction?"
1. Put items in cart
1. Select "Checkout"
1. Do not pay by CC, select "use other method"
1. Now cancel payment, item will be left "waiting for payment"
1. Seller will apply a discount on the pending order
1. Now you can pay with credit card

---
# Where is my item

* Internal tracking is good, but lots of clicks
* 3rd party tracking tool - Aftership (app, website) 

---

# No really, where is my item

* 60 day buyer protection
* Contact seller, preferably "auto confirm" triggers
* Seller will usually offer to make good.  If it's a shitty offer, say so
* Open dispute if unhappy (sellers appear terrified of disputes)
* Pay attention to your messages (you ignore, you lose)

# Can I have a shipload?
## AliBaba.com - Direct from wholesalers

---
class: bulletsh4

# Dealing with exporters

* Same process - search, buy
* Minimum buy quantity

---

# If you like it, put a ring on it
## Zero interaction buying is possible

---

# Or, open a Request for Quotes
## Bring your stick

---
# Talking to sellers
## Business at the speed of light

* Sellers will negotiate or customise
* Have an account on WeChat and Skype

---
# "How much for samples"?
## And in volume?

* Sellers will give you a sample price for 5ish items
* Volume pricing will be much better, of course

---
# Proforma Invoice
## Pay with PayPal

* Typically use paypal for sample orders
* Other methods possible for big orders

---
# Your new best friend

* Follow up will be cheerful, and persistent
* Be honest, if you don't like something, say so

---
# The government is not your friend

* Orders over $1000 will attract GST and processing fees
* $1000 order may attract $100GST plus $120 in fees.
* So make orders under $1000, or go really big
* GST-on-everything is probably coming soon
* "Parcel handling fee" would probably kill the market

# Alternatives to AliBaba

* a small number of items on aliExpress do ship from AU
* eBay --- but "location=australia" is NOT reliable
* DealExtreme.com (AU warehouse for some items)
* Amazon.com (They arrived.  Supply still poor.)
* Also-rans: .blue[uXcell.com], .blue[GearBest.com], .blue[BangGood.com]
* Many more: [ozbargain.com.au/wiki/list_of_buying_sites](https://www.ozbargain.com.au/wiki/list_of_buying_sites)
